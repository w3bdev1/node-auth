# Node-Auth
A NodeJS App to Show User Authentication

### Goals
- Use as minimum third party package as possible.
- Proper hashing of password.
- Prevent brute-force, timing attacks.
- Etc.

### Feature
- Major focus is on back-end authentication. So front-end styling is not given much priority.
- For simplicity data is saved on local JSON file, instead of a database.
